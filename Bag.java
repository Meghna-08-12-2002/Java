/* Key Concepts Used
Variable Declaration and Initialization – Different data types (String, int, float, double, boolean, char, byte, short, long) are declared and initialized.

Data Type Usage – Demonstrates usage of all primitive data types in Java, plus String (non-primitive).

Reassignment of Variables – Shows how variable values can be updated (e.g., brand = "Dell";).

Type-specific Suffixes – Proper use of:

f for float (e.g., 2499.50f)

L for long (e.g., 987654321012L)

Output with System.out.println() – Used for printing variable values before and after reassignment.

Single Class with main() Method – Everything is written in one class, which serves as the entry point.

Basic Syntax and Semantics – Demonstrates correct use of Java syntax, including semicolons, naming conventions, and statement structure.
